// Shared file: the three copies are kept the same (dev/check_shared.py checks).
//
// Hooks on the row above the prompt nest: each one gets the drawing of the hooks beneath it from
// next(e), as plain data ({ type, props, children }), and returns the whole drawing. Which mod is
// outer depends on the order the skills folder lists them, so this works in any order:
// - on the desktop, Smart PreCompact's row (key 'spc-band' or 'spc-receipt') takes the buttons when
//   it has room, and a shared row an inner mod drew before it is folded into it;
// - otherwise the shared row (key 'mods-row') takes them, at its end, along with any of the
//   collection's buttons an inner mod had put in Smart PreCompact's row, so they never split;
// - with no row to join, `seat` hands back what the mod's own shared row must also hold.
